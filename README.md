# sql-challenge
This challenge required me to practice modeling data using SQL techniques to model and engineer data into tables connected by their keys and then creating code that would allow me to make graphs interpreting the data. Finally, withthe graphs created, I would be able to analyse the data and determine its significance. I had trouble trying to use the Quick DBD weabsite to create the tables at first but after the help of a tutor and some classmates I was able to figure out how to create the tables and connect them in the proper way. I did get some help from some students in the class and online on how to properly code for the creation of the tables and how to use the tables to create my graphs. Thank you for taking the time to look at everything and let me know if I need to change anything!
